# FLOP Network — reports and feedback

The public intake for the **running** FLOP Network: bugs in nodes you operate, protocol
behaviour that contradicts the spec, gateway problems, docs gaps, and feature requests. The code lives elsewhere; this
repository holds the issues and the triage process.

## Where things go

| You have | Go to |
|---|---|
| Anything exploitable — verification bypass, slashing evasion, theft from an escrow, HTLC or voucher flow | **Private** report, per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Never a public issue. |
| A miner or validator misbehaving, crashing, or failing to sync | [Node bug](../../issues/new?template=node-bug.yml) |
| On-chain behaviour that contradicts the spec — a reward, slash, fee or settlement that came out wrong | [Protocol behaviour](../../issues/new?template=protocol.yml) |
| The hosted gateway or API returning errors or wrong prices | [Gateway](../../issues/new?template=gateway.yml) |
| Docs that are wrong, missing, or out of date | [Docs](../../issues/new?template=docs.yml) |
| Something you want the network or its tooling to do | [Feature request](../../issues/new?template=feature.yml) |
| An erratum, ambiguity, or challenge against the **specification** itself | [flop-labs/yellowpaper](https://github.com/flop-labs/yellowpaper/issues/new/choose) |
| A setup question | [ask.flop.finance](https://ask.flop.finance), which answers from the published docs |

The gateway is a convenience service run by FLOP Labs, not part of the protocol. A gateway outage
is not a network failure, and reports about it are kept separate on purpose.

## What does not belong here

- Exploits, in any form, including "I think this might be exploitable". See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- Price, token, or listing questions. There is no FLOP price and nothing here will discuss one.
- Support for third-party wallets, exchanges, or hosting providers.

## Triage

Every new issue starts as `status:triage`. A maintainer labels it by `area:` and `type:`, then
moves it to `status:accepted`, `status:needs-info`, or `status:wontfix`. An issue waiting on
`status:needs-info` for 14 days is marked stale and closes 7 days later unless someone replies.
Issues that turn out to be code work may be transferred to the relevant repository; they keep
their history and get `status:moved-to-core`.
